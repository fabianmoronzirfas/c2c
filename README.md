A collection of sketches for teaching computer to computer communication [@FH-Potsdam](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam).
These sketches are part of the seminars taking place in the Interface Lab.  




## Arduino And Processing  

### Needed Komponents  

- Computer  
- Arduino (Uno)  
- Arduino IDE  
- Processing IDE  
- Light Dependend Resistor  
- LED  
- RGB LED  
- 10k Ohm Resistor  
- 3 * 220 Ohm Resistor  
- Breadboard  
- Some wires  

#### 00 Serial Ports And Fritzing  
##### prerequisites  
Set up your Arduino with a LDR (light dependend resistor) and the LED like this.  
![fritzing-layout](00_Serial-Ports-And-Fritzing/fritzing/fritzing-layout.png)  

- One LDR leg goes to the 5V pin 
- one LDR leg to the analog 0 pin
- connect the 10k Ohm resistor to the analog 0 pin as well
- connect the other leg of the resitor to the GND pin
- connect the long leg of the LED to the 13 digital pin
- connect the short leg to the GND pin


##### Port Detection  
Connect your Arduino Board to your computer adn use the sketck [00_Serial-Ports-And-Fritzing/list_serial_ports/list_serial_ports.pde](00_Serial-Ports-And-Fritzing/list_serial_ports/list_serial_ports.pde) to see which port number is the one you choose in the Arduino IDE.  
**Yo need to modify all the .pde sketches to select the right serial port**  

#### 01 Arduino 2 Processing  

- Open and run the Processing sketch: 01_Arduino-2-Processing/pde/pde.pde  
- Open and upload the Arduino sketch: 01_Arduino-2-Processing/ino/ino.ino   

by waving your hand over the LDR you should be able to change the background color of the processing sketch.  

#### 02 Processing 2 Arduino

- Open and run the Processing sketch: 02_Processing-2-Arduino/pde/pde.pde  
- Open and upload the Arduino sketch: 02_Processing-2-Arduino/ino/ino.ino   

pressing UP and DOWN on your keyboard you can turn on a LED connected to pin 13  

#### 03 Poor Mans Oscilloscope

- Open and run the Processing sketch: 03_Poor-Mans-Oscilloscope/pde/pde.pde  
- Open and upload the Arduino sketch: 03_Poor-Mans-Oscilloscope/ino/ino.ino   

![poor mans oscilloscope](03_Poor-Mans-Oscilloscope/poor-mans-oscilloscope.png)  

By waving your hand over the LDR you should be able to change the line.

#### 04 Round Trip

- Open and run the Processing sketch: 04_Round-Trip/pde/pde.pde  
- Open and upload the Arduino sketch: 04_Round-Trip/ino/ino.ino  

![serial-monitor](04_Round-Trip/serial-monitor.gif)  

watch what happens in the serial monitor and the processing console. Messages are passed around...

#### 05 Processing 2 Arduino Motion Detection

- Open and run the Processing sketch: 05_Processing-2-Arduino-Motion-Detection/pde/pde.pde  
- Open and upload the Arduino sketch: 05_Processing-2-Arduino-Motion-Detection/ino/ino.ino  

by using the build in cam of our laptop or an webcam you can blink an LED by just moving infront of the camera.  

#### 06 Processing 2 Arduino Multiple Values

- Make a new arduino setup like this image  

![fritzing-layout](06_Processing-2-Arduino-Multiple-Values/fritzing/fritzing-layout.png)  

- Open and run the Processing sketch: 06_Processing-2-Arduino-Multiple-Values/pde/pde.pde  
- Open and upload the Arduino sketch: 06_Processing-2-Arduino-Multiple-Values/ino/ino.ino  

You can set the color of the RGB-LED from Processing.
